This work describes the research carried out using software tools on the process of calculating the fatigue life cycles of parts from an established geometry and a specific material. Data is introduced into the stress concentration factor Kt graphs, the maximum stress is obtained numerically, and finally, an S-N curve graph associated with the material is used to conclude with a value of fatigue life cycles. This demonstrates that complex calculation models or specific structural calculation software are not necessary to obtain clear evidence that the results are consistent, accurate, and close to the reality of the sector. Additionally, tests associated with the parts are not required, only with specimens in a laboratory.
